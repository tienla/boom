Contributions welcome!  If you'd like to help but don't know where to start, 
check out the TODO file. 

**Bug Reports**

Good bug reports are invaluable! Please try to provide reproducable code snippets 
and try to verify the behavior differs from the Spike RISC-V ISA simulator. 

**Feature Contributions**

We recommend that you consider contacting us before implementing your ideas. This will give you early feedback on the likelihood that we will be able to accept your changes, that you will not conflict with existing efforts, and will give you guidance that will help save you time on your own implementation.

We also recommend that you try to cut up contributions into smaller, digestable pieces that are easier-to-review and easier-to-maintain.


**Style Guide**

You can invoke `make checkstyle` to verify that your changes respect the style guide.
